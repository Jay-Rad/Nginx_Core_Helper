# Nginx Core Helper

This is a very poorly-made application.

It's really quite terrible.

I made this primarily to try out Avalonia UI (http://avaloniaui.net).  But it might also be helpful.  Maybe a little.

It's a Linux GUI app that helps you set up ASP.NET Core applications, running behind an Nginx reverse proxy.  It creates the Nginx config file and systemd services for you.
